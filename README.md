AUDI-Hospital-Management-System


Hospital Management System provides enhanced administration , control, superior patient care and improved profitability. It makes work of both user as well as of administration much easier. The project is based on the database , object oriented and networking techniques. We keep the records in database for which we are using Django framework and MY SQL software for backend which is one of the best software to keep the records. The project uses HTML ,CSS,JavaScript , Bootstrap for the frontend part which helps us in using all the functions of the database.
For the website of the project, the traversal is defined in such a way that on the landing page we get options to choose either of admin,doctor or patient login/signup page. On further scrolling we get the overview of the leading doctors of the hospital followed by a testimonial section where we have the most crucial of the feedback or comments our past patients have given. Furthermore, we get the section where  you can find the details for contacting us.
You can easily book an appointment with us by clicking on the tab you find on the top right corner of the site. There onto filling the description of the problem you face along with the department you feel this ailment corresponds to and the symptom, you easily book an appointment with us.
The registration for being part of the hospital by joining as a doctor or as a patient is a single step process where for the corresponding field you get redirected to a webpage wherein you can either choose to login or register if itâ€™s the first time for you with us.
The confirmation then is provided by the admin where in the admin has to login first and accept the registration of the respective doctor or patient. The admin dashboard shows the details regarding the doctor and the patients. For the doctor dashboard its details are showcased in form of singular cards with the functionality where the doctor can see the upcoming appointments he has to do. For patient dashboard we show the details on it as singular cards along with any upcoming appointments.
